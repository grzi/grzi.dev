            I am a passionate developer with a diverse skill set that spans multiple programming languages and
            technologies. My expertise lies in Java, Rust, Svelte, and operations, allowing me to tackle a wide range of
            projects and challenges. I enjoy to explore different business concepts and applications. I thrive on the
            excitement of solving complex problems and
            continuously learning new skills. In my spare time, I love developing video games as side projects. I also
            developed my custom game engine, scion, that you can find on my github.
            Additionally, I have a deep interest in retro gaming and enjoy speedrunning various games.
