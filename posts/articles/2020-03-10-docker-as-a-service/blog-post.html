<h1>How to use <em>docker as a service</em> on a remote machine ?</h1>

<p>Yeah, I know what you're thinking... But I can explain it all, I promise !</p>

<h2>Why ?</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on a macbook pro 2017 (no touch bar) that have only 8Gb of RAM.</p>

<p>My basic opened work tools are the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>IntelliJ / Visual studio code</li>
<li>Postman</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Spotify / Slack</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that my current project is a big one, with like 50 maven modules and vue js projects. My intelliJ is taking a lot of RAM, and a lot of time to reindex files.</p>

<p>I can't change my machine right now, so I need to optimize a bit my usage to save some RAM. I saw that my docker on mac is taking no less than 1.5GB (Even if I limit it to 1GB) ! That's overkill, because I only need docker for local postgres, local mongo, local elastic search ... and it's taking this even when no container is running...
So, I thought I could use a remote docker instance instead of using my local one. For my simple needs, it's okay for me.</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>

<p>So, this is what I need to create a simple <strong>docker as a service</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li>A remote machine to install docker</li>
<li>Configure a DNS on the development computer to simplify the usage</li>
<li>Configure the ssh key to be able to run ssh command from the machine</li>
<li>Configure an alias command to
<ul>
<li>ssh to the remote machine</li>
<li>launch the docker commands</li>
<li>get the output from the command</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm currently using a simple VPS that I pay 3,59€ per month. (<a href="https://www.kimsufi.com/fr/">Kimsufi</a>). This VPS is not dedicated to my docker as a service, I have other things on it.</p>

<p>I set up a simple dns entry in my <code>etc/hosts</code> file</p>

<pre><code>XX.XX.XX.XX     dockercloud
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I need to generate a ssh key :</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
</code></pre>

<p>I simply add this generated key to the vps :</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id root@XX.XX.XX.XX
</code></pre>

<p>I create an alias in my .bashrc (actually in my .zProfile) :</p>

<pre><code>dockeraas() {
    echo 'I am running on the cloud ¯\_(ツ)_/¯'
    ssh root@dockercloud "docker $@"
}
</code></pre>

<p>After I have set up all this things, I can just run my docker command as usual :</p>

<pre><code>$ : dockeraas ps
I am running on the cloud ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
35dc9622cd36        postgres:10.5       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    0.0.0.0:5432-&gt;5432/tcp     order_db
444476070ef8        mongo               "docker-entrypoint.s…"   9 months ago        Up 9 months         0.0.0.0:27017-&gt;27017/tcp   brave_morse
</code></pre>

<p>And now I'm good to go. 1.5GB available on my local machine to give to google chrome :P !</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>I have now more than 1.5 GB free to use on my machine</li>
<li>It's simple to set up for basic needs like docker run</li>
<li>I can still launch my docker in local if I need it (example for maven compilation based on docker)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>You need a more complicated script and alias thing to handle docker-compose and volumes BUT it is possible</li>
<li>You need to have an Internet connection, so no dockeraas in a plane</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I'm concerned, I plan on working a bit more on this. I want to be able to use more complicated command from my dockeraas command. For example, I usually need to use cross compilation from rust. It's based on docker, so I guess I could compile it directly on my remote machine instead of using my local one.</p>
