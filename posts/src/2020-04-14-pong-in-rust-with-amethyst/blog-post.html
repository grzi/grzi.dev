<h1>A pong in rustlang with amethyst.rs</h1>

<p>I often work on my own little games, in my spare time, to learn, make the good tech choice and be ready to start the real big game project that I always wanted to do. Doing this, I've been using a lot of game engine in the last years :</p>

<ul>
<li>Unity 3D</li>
<li>Unreal engine</li>
<li>Godot engine</li>
<li>RPG maker</li>
<li>Lumberyard</li>
<li>... (even LWJGL 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these game engines / lib gave me the feeling of over-powering my needs (except LWJGL 2, but I don't want a java game). They all are really nice engines and softwares. I've made multiple games with Unity3D, and I will certainly make more, because it's accessible and quick to get started with a new game. But with all these engines, I really don't have the feeling to understand technically speaking all that I'm doing. Indeed, when you create a shader in unity, like a glowing effect. You'll search for "glowing effect shader" on your search engine, and surely find a shader that fill your needs. And that's awesome. But I want to understand these things, not just use them.  I could just learn how it works on Unity, but I want to deep dive into it and know what's behind the scene.</p>

<p>So, for now, I'm looking for a minimalist game engine. The one that will gave me the sensation of "doing" it and that will make me think, maybe during a lot of days, to understand the purpose of concepts like shaders, 3D movements, velocity, gravity...</p>

<h2>What is Amethyst ?</h2>

<p>Amethyst is a Data-driven game engine written in Rust. It uses the ECS concepts to build all the game logic. To quote the amethyst.rs website :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ECS is rich in features and very efficient, as it never does any memory locking while remaining entirely thread-safe.</p>
  
  <p>-- <cite>amethyst.rs</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's beginner friendly, but you need to know how to code in rustlang before. It can be used to make 2D, or 3D games and has advanced features, and more coming.</p>

<p>It is sponsored by some companies like : Netlify, JFrog, Digital Ocean.</p>

<p>It comes as a crate that you import in your rust project. It hasn't any software with ui. Just libs.</p>

<p>And, it is OPEN SOURCE. (yeah !!!)</p>

<h2>A simple pong</h2>

<p>I followed the tutorial that is in the amethyst book to make a pong. And what a pleasure !</p>

<h3>The ron format</h3>

<p>Amethyst supports by default the usage of ron configs. Ron stands for Rusty object notation and is an alternative to json format. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>

<h3>Entity-Component-System</h3>

<p>As I said before, Amethyst is based on the ECS concepts. So to build the game, you must follow them. 
What does it brings ? Good practices, I guess. And moreover, a structured game. You're forced to 
think your game logic to make it fit ECS.   </p>

<p>In the pong, entities are paddles, balls. Components are the properties associated (like the color, the velocity..). </p>

<p>Systems are the logic behind the paddle movements, behind the ball bounce or behind the scoring.
Systems usually controls the components and entities.  </p>

<p>Moreover, you have to handle the camera, textures, sprites... </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Doing this tutorial, I've been greatly surprised on how simple is this game engine to learn. I also took some time to read a bit the code behind some of the features I've used. And that is really cool, because it's helping me to understand how simple things like how camera works. </p>

<p>I'm currently making my own little tetris like to go further in the learning on amethyst. I don't know if my good feelings will continue, but for now, I feel like this game engine is going to learn me a lot of things, and just for this, I recommend every one who has a bit of free time to test it. </p>
