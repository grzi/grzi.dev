<h1>Pixel art learning (part 1: Newbie stage)</h1>

<p>So I want to learn pixel art. </p>

<p>I'm a developer, and I really need to sketch up my mini games, and maybe some day, be able to make mines. 
I've been searching on internet something like "How do I learn pixel art ?" and I found... well, a lot of things.</p>

<p>This list of blog post is absolutelly not an 'how to' learn pixel art. It's just my diary on how I'm trying to do it.</p>

<h2>Should I know how to draw to make pixel art ?</h2>

<p>Well, that's the first question I've asked myself and tried to answer by reading tutorials. Some pixel artists say that it's mandatory to be able to make good drawings, and most others say that it's not mandatory. It's a matter of creativity, style and learnings (and perseverance I guess).</p>

<p>So, about this, my feeling is: NO, I don't need to be an experienced artist to start learning pixel art. It will sure be helpful because I would know some concepts like shading, perspective... But I will also learn these concepts by learning pixel art, so, let's go ! Just do it !
(But yes, I, don't forget to take some time to learn some theory)</p>

<h2>Where should I start ?</h2>

<p>That's a long way I'm going into. Learning an art. What do I do ? Do I just open my software and draw ? clic clic clic? 
Well.. no, that's not how it works when you're as poor skilled as me in this domain. 
You'll have to read and watch tutorials. And a lot of them.</p>

<p><strong>The stepped I've followed for now are the following :</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Understand well what is pixel art. How it works. What are the different kinds of pixel arts.</li>
<li>Learning the tools I need to start to make mines.</li>
<li>Learning a bit of colour theory to understand why I can't just pick random colors to make my pixels arts.</li>
<li>Try try and try again... (and mostly fail and redo)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here is a list of resources I follow to get into pixel art :</strong></p>

</ol>

<h2>Starts with 1 bit pixel art</h2>

<p>A cool exercise I've started to do is to work on a 16 * 16 pixel sprite with only 1 bit colors (That means 2 colors, so in general black and white). This way, I need to focus on the shapes of the thing I want to represent, and then add simple lighnings to it.</p>

<p>For example, if I want to represent a hammer. For now, the only thing that counts for me (remember I'm a newbie) is to be able to create the right drawing form.
So I will try to make it look nice with only 2 colors and 16 pixel large. </p>

<p>This is the result for this : </p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grzi/grzi.dev.statics/main/hammer.png" class="pixel-art-img" alt="hammer"/></p>

<p><em>I know it isn't perfect but I think it looks like a hammer. So it's a first win, nah ?</em></p>

<h2>What should I avoid ?</h2>

<ul>
<li>To just copy and redo already existing pixel arts. yeah yeah I've been there. Just copying things I see. Instead of this, I now try to use them as a model, but don't just redraw on top of them.</li>
<li>Don't ignore the rules of pixel art you'll learn in the tutorials (Like doubles, jaggy)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion &amp; next goal</h2>

<p>Few ! It's gonna be a long way before I get skilled on this. But, I'm gonna try to keep practicing and learning ! 
Currently, I'm making the daily challenge on lospec which is to represent a word with a given color palet. It's a good exercise.</p>

<p>My next goal is to create a simple scene with a 4 colors palet (A game boy style) and try to make a mini game with it ! </p>

<p><strong>See you in the next chapter !</strong></p>
